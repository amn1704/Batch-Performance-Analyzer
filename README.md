# Batch-Performance-Analyzer
The Batch Performance Analyzer is a Python-based data analysis project designed to clean, analyze, visualize, and compare student performance using Quiz and Mid-Sem examination scores.

The project focuses on clarity, fairness, and insight, making it useful for academic analysis, performance reporting, and student comparison.

## Features
- Data cleaning and validation
- Subject-wise performance analysis
- Identification of top scorers and class averages
- Clear and minimal visualizations
- Student-to-student performance comparison

## Dataset Requirements
The dataset must be a CSV file containing:
- Admission No.
- Name
- Subject-wise columns in the format:
  - `<Subject Name>_Quiz`
  - `<Subject Name>_Mid Sem`

## How It Works
- You Load the dataset
- It Clean and validate marks and student information
- It Analyze each subject individually
- It Visualize score distribution and class trends
- You Compare performance between selected students

## Visual Output
- Subject-wise score distribution
- Highlighted top scorers
- Average score reference
- Student-Student Comparision Terminal
- All visualizations are optimized for readability and academic reporting.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook(Kaggle)

## Reusability
This project can be easily reused with any academic dataset by maintaining consistent column naming conventions.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to transform raw academic data into meaningful insights, helping educators and students better understand performance patterns.
